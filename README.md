It contains data of rain from the past few years
ABSTRACT

This project is carried on the heuristic prediction of rainfall using machine learning techniques. As we all know agriculture was the leading issue of our country and economy. Even though a regular rain pattern is usually played important role for healthy agriculture but too much rainfall or too little rainfall can be injurious, even it led to destructive for crops. The decreasing trends in seasonal rainfall and post-monsoon rainfall and increasing occurrence of the deficit rainfall years indicates the probable intensification of water scarcity. This project calculates the rate of rainfall in previous years according to various crops season like rabbi, Kharif, zaid and predicts the rainfall in future seasons. We have selected a real data set which consists of past yearâ€™s rainfall rate accorded to various seasons. This website results in helping farmers to make a correct decision to harvest a particular crop accordingly to crops seasons.
The estimation of rainfall is of great importance in terms of water resources management human life and their environment. It can be met with the approximate or incomplete estimation problems because rainfall estimation is affected from the geographical and regional changes and properties. This paper presents review of different methods used for rainfall prediction and problems one might encounter while applying different approaches for rainfall forecasting.
